<p style="text-align:left">The participating members for Team 12’s phase one project are Ramsey Morrow, Brandon Jones, Deondre North, Keaton Rohlfs, Liam Tucker, and Quillen Flanigan. 
The goal of this phase of the project was to read and learn the inner workings of the ChocAn Data Center, 
as we will be designing its system. This project consists of four actors: EOW Report Timer, Provider, Manager, and Operator. 
The 10 use cases we found include the Accounting Procedure, creating the four report types, requesting those reports, 
billing ChocAn, validating members, accessing the provider directory, editing the member and provider lists, 
and adding, deleting, and updating the occupants of those lists. 
A few assumptions were made. First, we assumed that all written data is always inputted correctly. 
Secondly, we assumed that the reports requested by the manager were sent directly to their respective terminal. 
The main file, Report.html, contains our primary use case diagram with its respective use case descriptions, the glossary, 
the header and task distribution tables, and our Bitbucket information. 
Also included in the main file is our individual submissions, which include our independent use case diagrams 
and their respective header and task distribution tables, which were unanimously agreed upon by the team.</p>
